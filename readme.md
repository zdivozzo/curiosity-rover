#Pictures from Mars

Exploring Mars through the Curiosity rover and NASA's API.  Lots of accidental selfies and barren wasteland to follow.

To install, just run

`npm install` and `webpack-dev-server`

If you want to get your own key, go to [api.nasa.gov](api.nasa.gov) to grab one and swap out the api key constant in src/scripts/site.js.  The default key is the DEMO_KEY provided by NASA.  It cuts you off after 30 requests.
